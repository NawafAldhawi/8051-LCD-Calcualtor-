# 8051 Assembly - Code.a51

This repository contains an **8051 Assembly (.a51)** program written for the **Intel 8051 microcontroller family**. The code can be assembled and simulated using tools like **Keil uVision**, **ASM51**, or other 8051-compatible assemblers.

## üìÑ File

- `Code.a51` ‚Äî Main assembly source file

##  About

This project is part of a learning exercise or embedded system application using the 8051 microcontroller. The specific functionality can be viewed in the `Code.a51` source.



## Tools You Can Use

- [Keil uVision IDE](https://www.keil.com/download/product/)
- [MCU 8051 IDE](http://mcu8051ide.sourceforge.net/)
- Proteus (for simulation)
- SDCC (Small Device C Compiler, if integrating C)

##  How to Run

1. Open the `.a51` file in Keil uVision or another 8051 assembler.
2. Assemble the code.
3. Flash to your 8051 hardware or simulate with software.
4. Monitor output (e.g., LEDs, UART, etc.).
